## Plotting simple graphs in python with seaborn
Here I'm using Old Faithful dataset from R "transporting" it to Python.
#descriptive statistics and boxplot
First, we are trying to take a simple look at the dataset. 
```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import os
os.environ['QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH'] = 'C:/Users/olgao/Anaconda3/Library/plugins/platforms'


faithful=r.faithful 
faithful.describe()

#boxplot
sns.set_style("darkgrid")
sns.boxplot(data=faithful)
plt.title("Faithful geyser")
plt.show()


```

The boxplot is not really informative however if we visualize a possible relationship between the variables, we can see two disinct populations of geysers!

And this is confirmed by histogram as well.
